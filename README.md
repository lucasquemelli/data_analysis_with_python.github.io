# Data acquisition 

There are various formats for a dataset: .csv, .json, .xlsx etc. The dataset can be stored in different places, on your local machine or sometimes online.

The Pandas Library is a useful tool that enables us to read various datasets into a dataframe; our Jupyter notebook platforms have a built-in Pandas Library so that all we need to do is import Pandas without installing.

# Read Data

We use pandas.read_csv() function to read the csv file. In the brackets, we put the file path along with a quotation mark so that pandas will read the file into a dataframe from that address. The file path can be either an URL or your local file address.

Because the data does not include headers, we can add an argument headers = None inside the read_csv() method so that pandas will not automatically set the first row as a header.

We can also assign the dataset to any variable you create.

After reading the dataset, we can use the dataframe.head(n) method to check the top n rows of the dataframe, where n is an integer. Contrary to dataframe.head(n), dataframe.tail(n) will show you the bottom n rows of the dataframe.
